## File Templates
For convenience, you can use file templates for Rider. To do this, you should take the files from `EMA/Rider/FileTemplates`, open Rider, and go to `Files -> Manage IDE Settings -> Import settings...`

## Additionally
Here is a simple example of using the architecture. Just add the `Player.cs` script from the  `EMA.Examples` namespace, to the object.
